During earlier runs we hit jsdom/parse5 ESM issues due to the environment and Node version. To avoid that, the test config uses the Node environment (in vitest.config.js) so tests run reliably. If you want full DOM testing (jsdom) later, upgrade Node to >=20.19.0 (or >=22.12.0) and switch environment to jsdom.
package.json was updated by npm to reflect installed devDependency versions.
