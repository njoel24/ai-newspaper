## 3. High-Level Flow

1. **TrendAgent** collects trending topics (e.g., from APIs or simulated sources) and stores them.
2. **PlannerAgent** decides which topics to write about using an LLM and past engagement data.
3. **WriterAgent** generates full articles (title, summary, body).
4. **PublisherAgent** publishes content (to file system, DB, or API endpoint).
5. **EvaluatorAgent** analyzes performance and updates topic weights or preferences.

The process repeats daily or hourly via a **Scheduler**.
